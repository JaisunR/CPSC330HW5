    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework you will be working on an open-ended mini-project, where you will put all the different things you have learned so far together to solve an interesting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes and tips when you work on this mini-project: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips\n",
    "1. This mini-project is open-ended, and while working on it, there might be some situations where you'll have to use your own judgment and make your own decisions (as you would be doing when you work as a data scientist). Make sure you explain your decisions whenever necessary. \n",
    "2. **Do not include everything you ever tried in your submission** -- it's fine just to have your final code. That said, your code should be reproducible and well-documented. For example, if you chose your hyperparameters based on some hyperparameter optimization experiment, you should leave in the code for that experiment so that someone else could re-run it and obtain the same hyperparameters, rather than mysteriously just setting the hyperparameters to some (carefully chosen) values in your code. \n",
    "3. If you realize that you are repeating a lot of code try to organize it in functions. Clear presentation of your code, experiments, and results is the key to be successful in this lab. You may use code from lecture notes or previous lab solutions with appropriate attributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assessment\n",
    "We plan to grade fairly and leniently. We don't have some secret target score that you need to achieve to get a good grade. **You'll be assessed on demonstration of mastery of course topics, clear presentation, and the quality of your analysis and results.** For example, if you just have a bunch of code and no text or figures, that's not good. If you do a bunch of sane things and get a lower accuracy than your friend, don't sweat it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A final note\n",
    "Finally, this style of this \"project\" question is different from other assignments. It'll be up to you to decide when you're \"done\" -- in fact, this is one of the hardest parts of real projects. But please don't spend WAY too much time on this... perhaps \"a few hours\" (10-14 hours???) is a good guideline for this project . Of course if you're having fun you're welcome to spend as much time as you want! But, if so, try not to do it out of perfectionism or getting the best possible grade. Do it because you're learning and enjoying it. Students from the past cohorts have found such kind of labs useful and fun and I hope you enjoy it as well. "

    "\n",
    "### Option 1\n",
    "You can choose to work on a classification problem of predicting whether a credit card client will default or not. \n",
    "For this problem, you will use [Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset). In this data set, there are 30,000 examples and 24 features, and the goal is to estimate whether a person will default (fail to pay) their credit card bills; this column is labeled \"default.payment.next.month\" in the data. The rest of the columns can be used as features. You may take some ideas and compare your results with [the associated research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417407006719), which is available through [the UBC library](https://www.library.ubc.ca/). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2\n",
    "You can choose to work on a regression problem using a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) of New York City Airbnb listings from 2019. As usual, you'll need to start by downloading the dataset, then you will try to predict `reviews_per_month`, as a proxy for the popularity of the listing. Airbnb could use this sort of model to predict how popular future listings might be before they are posted, perhaps to help guide hosts create more appealing listings. In reality they might instead use something like vacancy rate or average rating as their target, but we do not have that available here.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note there is an updated version of this dataset with more features available [here](http://insideairbnb.com/). The features were are using in `listings.csv.gz` for the New York city datasets. You will also see some other files like `reviews.csv.gz`. For your own interest you may want to explore the expanded dataset and try your analysis there.

The dataset contains demographic, finacial and payment history features which can contribute to deafult risk. The target will likely be imbalanced, since most clients are expected not to default, so metrics like precision, recall and F1-score will be more informative than accuracy. Preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables, scaling, and handling imbalance will be important before modeling."

Overall I believe the linear model provides a better trade off in favouring f1-score, particularly recall over accuracy since in a real world context missing a defaulter would be more costly than more false positives."

    "2. Across all the different models the perfromance was similar but compared to logistic regression they were all able to improve upon its performance quite a bit. Random Forest had significantlly longer train time but similar score time to logistic regression, it was able to achieve a higher accuracy score of ~0.81 and f1-score of ~0.47. Random forest had an almost perfect training metrics indicating overfitting despite having good test metrics also. Light GBM was able to perform the best out of all the other models, it had comparable training time to logistic regression and similar score time. Light GBM achieved an accuracy score of ~0.82 and f1-score of ~0.48 on the test data and the performance on the train data was a bit higher which can be a result of slight overfitting. SVM with the rbf kernal had the longest train and score time out of all the other models by a good margin. SVM was able to achieve an test accuracy score of ~0.82 and an f1-score of ~0.46 the train scores were very similar also indicating the model generalizes well compared to the others. Overall all the different models were able to improve accuracy significantlly compared to logistic regression and with slight imporvements in f1-score, precision and recall. With hyperparameter optimzation I believe they will be able to improve even more and have a larger gap with logsitic regression."

Hyperparameter optimization successfully controlled overfitting in more complex models. Accuracy may have dropped at the cost of a higher f1-score which is overall a more important metric for the models than accuracy. Random forest had the biggest improvement and is now the best model achieving a f1-score of ~0.55. Adjusting the hyperparameters also drastically improved the overfitting for random forest."

    "The feature importance analysis for random forest shows that recent payment behavior is the strongest predictor of credit default. Features like PAY_0, PAY_MEAN, and PAY_2 had the highest importance scores, indicating that customers with recent delayed or missed payments are far more likely to default. Other payment history features such as PAY_3–PAY_5 also contributed notably. Financial variables such as LIMIT_UTILIZATION and PAY_AMT_MEAN ranked next, suggesting that high credit usage and lower average payments increase default risk. Overall, the model primarily relies on payment timeliness and credit utilization to assess default risk."

    "My biggest takeaway from the supervised machine learning material is that model success depends far more on understanding the data and evaluation metrics than simply choosing a complex algorithm. I learned that preprocessing, feature engineering, and preventing overfitting are just as important as model selection. Interpreting results through metrics like precision, recall, and F1 helped me see that different models serve different goals depending on the problem. Overall, the most valuable lesson was learning how to build models that not only perform well but also generalize and make sense in context."
